Based on Professor’s comments for our first phase, we modified our frontend website and the introduction of our updated version is as follows:

## Description 
Our website is called “LetsGrocery”  and the target audiences are the merchant, as well as administrator, who will provide products of different categories (they can add, delete or edit the information of all products), check customers’ orders, and reply to customers’ questions, and customers, who are able to view the products of different categories, selected the items that they would like to buy and add them to the shopping cart, then check them out. Also, they are able to manage their account, they can set their information like address, view their previous orders, and ask and answer any questions in the chatbox. Our online shopping website consists of the following key pages: User Registration and Login Page, Category Page, Shopping Cart Page, Checkout Page, Customer Profile Page, Merchant Profile Page. 

### Introduction to Web Pages
- Login/Register Page: Customers and merchants could use email addresses to log in to their accounts. Once they choose which identity they will use to log in, the page will navigate to different pages: customers will go to their account first and merchants will enter in the merchant profile page. If the customer is new to our online shopping web, the website will lead them to the registration page to create a new account. 

- Category Page: The only way to navigate this page is from the customer profile page. Once navigating to this page, it shows all the products that the merchant sell and when you click on the sidebar, the page will display the products in different categories. Also, by clicking on each product, the customer is able to get known more information about the product detail. The window will show the product name, price, and description of the product. Below the picture, there is an increment/decrement icon that can use to select the quantity of products and then add them to the shopping cart. With the quantity changing, the number on the shopping cart icon can also go up and down. If you want to see what you have in the shopping cart, click on that button and it will navigate you to the shopping cart page.

- Shopping Cart Page: The customers can check what they have added to the shopping cart page. It shows the quantity and also the price of each item, the total price of all items, and the payment price which includes the delivery fee as well. The functions of this page include removing the items that you do not want anymore,  incrementing or decrementing the quantity of each item, choosing the different delivery types, and seeing how much you cost on this order.

- Customer Profile Page: There are several functionalities on the page. The customers can check historical orders, by clicking on the print invoices button, customers are able to get the detail of their previous order. As the sidebar shows, customers can always change their addresses and personal information. If they have any questions or concerns, they can leave their thoughts on the chatbox page, or they can also reply to other customers’ questions.

- Merchant Profile Page: The website has three main parts. The first part shows the dashboard of the merchant, which can realize adding/editing/removing the inventory of the items function. Also, the merchant is able to delete the whole category if he/she decides to remove it. The second part displays that the merchant can check customers’ orders, it shows all customers’ orders at the beginning and the merchant can select the specific customer orders to view. For the third part, the merchant can view all the questions that are asked by customers and then reply to their questions in the chatbox.
